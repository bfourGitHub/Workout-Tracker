# Workout-Tracker
Unit 17 Nosql Assignment. UW Coding Boot Camp.

## Description

For this assignment, we were required to create a workout-tracking application that would allow the user to track several chosen metrics. This workout tracker uses mongoDB, mongoose and Express to handle routes. 

With the front-end fully developed the back-end our primary objective was to connect html and api routes so our application returned that stats the user is looking for: see user story. 

Overall this application was a great exercise in using databases and connecting the front and back ends of an application.

## User Story

* As health-conscious and physically active person
* I want to be able to keep track of my workout statistics
* So that I can track my progress

I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 

I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. 

If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.


## Acceptance Criteria

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.
